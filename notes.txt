# Checkers 

# Questions
  * Would this be built out in the future to maybe power other Engine::Games.
  * Would there be any AI that we would need to build
  * How will users interact with this Engine::Game
- Classes
  - Piece
    - Base class which has common functions between all pieces.
    - Broken down between black and black
    - Only responsible for knowing if it is killed. Would not have    responsibility over movement. In this case the board would have to track all of this. 
    - Could have just a Piece class that knows where it is on the board and the color of the piece.
  - CheckersPiece << Piece
    - This class would be able to tell you legal moves according to the checkers rules
    - Would know of their possible moves but not actually execute the moves (maybe)
  - Engine::Game or Board
    - God class holding the majority of the responsibility
    - When the CheckersPiece has access to the board they would be able to know a list of possible moves
  - Moves
  - DisplayBoard


# General
  - Board class that has information about what pieces are where
  - Piece class knows all of its legal moves based on an empty grid and then would check with the Board class before making the move to ensure it is valid.
